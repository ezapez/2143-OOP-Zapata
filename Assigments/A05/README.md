## Definitions

### Abstraction
> To define this to a non-programmer lets think about how we use a social media app like twitter.
> For example, regular users on the app are allowed to tweet, dm, and view other functions the app allows to be seen for the user. 
> However the user does not know how each function they are using works 
> This is basically what abstraction is it allows the essential information to be viewed, but hides the irrelevant details from the user.
