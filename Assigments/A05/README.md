## Definitions

### Abstraction
> To define this to a non-programmer lets think about how we use a social media app like twitter.
> For example, regular users on the app are allowed to tweet, dm, and view other functions the app allows to be seen for the user. 
> However the user does not know how each function they are using works. 
> This is basically what abstraction is it allows the essential information to be viewed, but hides the irrelevant details from the user.

### Attributes / Properties
> Lets start with Properties and continue using  twitter for an example. 
> Properties are describing the users for their username, email, phone#, and profile image.
> Pretty much  he characteristics of ther users basic twitter information.
> Attributes is additional information about the user. 
> for example, username: ezapez, email:johndoe@gmail.com, phone#:940-642-*****, and etc.

### Class 
> Classes are the main blueprint or plan of your code. What I mean is once you want to write a project in any programming languaged having classes will help break down and create a more smooth  code. Class are a template for creating objects that house attrubutes and methods to be used at any time in the code.

## Class Variable 
> A class variable is any type of varable that is declared within the class 
> Main ones are Static Variable, instance variable, and local variable.

## Composition
> Basic term is building complex objects from smaller ones 
> The main idea for use in c++ is to make it more easier and simple to input complex classes in our class.

## Constructor
> A Member function that has the same name as the class. Used to initialize values, is automatically executed, but can not house return types or void. We also have a Default constructor which no arguments are passed.
> example: 
class student{
    public:
        student();
};

## Encapsulation
> Holds all the data together and the funtion that are using them 
> For example, a function needing data from another funciton can't directly access them, but 
> can request for that data from that function. Which can then be used by the first function.

## Friends
>Are functions of a class define outside the scope of it. Which have the right to access all the
> private and protected members of the class.
> However they are not member functions, its used for templates.

## Inheritence
